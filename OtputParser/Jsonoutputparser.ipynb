Once something crosses the event horizon, it is trapped by the black hole's gravity and cannot escape.

The laws of physics as we know them break down at the singularity, making it a region of spacetime that is not well understood. The singularity is thought to be the result of the extreme gravitational compression of the star's matter.\"}, 'fact4': {'title': 'Hawking Radiation', 'text': 'In the 1970s, physicist Stephen Hawking proposed that black holes emit radiation, now known as Hawking radiation. This theory suggests that black holes have a temperature and entropy, and that they slowly lose mass over time due to this radiation. Hawking radiation is a result of virtual particles that exist in the quantum vacuum near the event horizon.'}, 'fact5': {'title': 'Black Hole Collisions', 'text': 'In recent years, scientists have detected gravitational waves produced by the collisions of black holes. These collisions result in the merger of two black holes, which releases a massive amount of energy in the form of gravitational waves. The detection of these waves has confirmed a key prediction made by Einstein a century ago and has opened up a new field of astronomy that allows us to study cosmic events in ways previously impossible.'}}\n"
